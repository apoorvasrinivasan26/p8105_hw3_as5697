Problem 1
=========

### 1.1

``` r
data(brfss_smart2010)
```

``` r
brfss = brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>%
  filter(response %in% c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")) %>% 
  rename(state = locationabbr, county = locationdesc) %>%
  mutate(response = as.factor(response)) %>% 
  mutate(
    response = fct_relevel(response, c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"))
    )
```

### 1.2

In 2002, which states were observed at 7 locations?

``` r
brfss %>% 
  filter(year == 2002) %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarize(n_locations = n_distinct(county)) %>% 
  filter(n_locations == 7) %>%
  head()
## # A tibble: 3 x 2
##   state n_locations
##   <chr>       <int>
## 1 CT              7
## 2 FL              7
## 3 NC              7
```

### 1.3

Make a “spaghetti plot” that shows the number of locations in each state from 2002 to 2010.

``` r
brfss %>%
  group_by(year, state) %>%
  summarize(num_locations = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = num_locations, color = state)) + 
  labs(
    title = "Spaghetti plot of number of locations in each state from 2002 to 2010",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Number of locations") +
  geom_line() + 
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE) 
```
